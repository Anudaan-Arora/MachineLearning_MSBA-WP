## Week 8 assignment

This week's assignment focuses on the conceptual aspects of regression trees.

1. Draw an example (of your own invention) of a partition of two-dimensional feature space that could result from recursive binary splitting. Your example should contain at least six regions. Draw a decision tree corresponding to this partition. Be sure to label all aspects of your figures, including the regions $R_1, R_2, . . .,$ the cutpoints $t_1,t_2,...,$ and so forth. Hint: Your result should look something like Figures 8.1 and 8.2 in ISL.

2. Provide a detailed explanation of the algorithm that is used to fit a regression tree.

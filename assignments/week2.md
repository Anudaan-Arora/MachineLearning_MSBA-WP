## Week 2 assignment

This assignment focuses on two data sets and will sharpen your data visualization and wrangling skills.  The first is [Titanic survival data](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/dpuelz/MachineLearning_MSBA-WP/blob/main/data/TitanicSurvival.csv) and the second is [NYC flight data](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/dpuelz/MachineLearning_MSBA-WP/blob/main/data/nycflights13.csv).

Each of the questions requires you to practice your data visualization and wrangling skills.  Moreover, they represent commonly worded "data science tasks" that a supervisor might ask of you.  There are many ways to write R code to get to the answers, and no one way is best!  

- For the Titanic data, How did survival among adult passengers on the Titanic vary by sex and passenger class?  Please provide visual and numerical evidence.

- For the NYC flight data, what times of year have the worst/best average departure delays, and does this vary by departure airport? - Which routes from the NYC area gained the most time in the air, on average? - Which carriers have the best “on-time performance,” defined as the proportion of flights arriving within 10 minutes of their scheduled arrival time? (i.e. no more than 10 minutes
late)

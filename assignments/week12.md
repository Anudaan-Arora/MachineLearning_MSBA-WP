## Week 12 assignment

This week's assignment is a repeat of last week's, now using PCA!

The data in [wine.csv](../data/wine.csv) contains information on 11 chemical properties of 6500 different bottles of _vinho verde_ wine from northern Portugal.  In addition, two other variables about each wine are recorded:
- whether the wine is red or white  
- the quality of the wine, as judged on a 1-10 scale by a panel of certified wine snobs.  

Run a principal components analysis on the 11 chemical properties (or suitable transformations thereof) and summarize your results. Is your clustering aproach able to adequately distinguish the reds from the whites based on only the information contained in the chemical properties?  Does your approach also seem capable of distinguishing the higher from the lower quality wines?  Provide visual evidence.

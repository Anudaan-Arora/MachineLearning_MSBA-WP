## Week 5 assignment

This question involves the use of multiple linear regression on the [Auto](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/dpuelz/MachineLearning_MSBA-WP/blob/main/data/Auto.csv) data set.

1. Produce a scatterplot matrix which includes all of the variables in the data set.
2. Compute the matrix of correlations between the variables using the function `cor()`. You will need to exclude the name variable, which is qualitative.
3. Use the `lm()` function to perform a multiple linear regression with mpg as the response and all other variables except name as the predictors. Use the `summary()` function to print the results. Comment on the output. For instance:
 -- Is there a relationship between the predictors and the re- sponse?
 -- Which predictors appear to have a statistically significant relationship to the response?
 -- What does the coefficient for the year variable suggest?

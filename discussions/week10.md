## Week 10 discussion

Describe the process of bootstrapping to understand sampling variability.  How exactly does it generate variation in estimates by using the same data set over and over?  Propose a specific task with data of your choice (e.g., building a regression model, and the data can be imaginary or real), and walk through a description of the boostrap in that scenario.  Here's my example: I have data on the heights of a sample of US males.  I calculate the average height of this sample and can estimate the standard error by doing ...

## Week 5 discussion

1. Describe the bias-variance tradeoff in your own words.  What are its practical concerns, and how can we successfully navigate this tradeoff curve?  

2. Imagine you're an engineer at Tesla, and you're designing the autopilot self-driving system.  Describe how this job is essentially designing a supervised learning model (be specific about the function you're trying to estimate as well as its input and output).  Discuss in detail why it is imperative to be aware of the bias-variance in this setting.

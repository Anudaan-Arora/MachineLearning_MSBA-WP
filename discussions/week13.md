## Week 13 discussion

Your task for this discussion is to peruse the internet for a data set with network information.  Provide a link to the data and describe the network embedded in it.  For example, I found data on the St. Louis Fed website describing trade flows between countries around the world.  The countries are the network nodes, and the existence of a trade flow between country A and country B means there's an edge between those two nodes.

## Week 2 discussion questions

- In the data visualization [slide deck](/slides/week2-dataviz.pdf), there are figures from major media outlets that are bad!  Please go through each of these figures (in the data viz hall of shame) and briefly describe how they are wrong or misleading.  Discuss in small groups.

## Week 2 discussion

In the data visualization [slide deck](/slides/week2-dataviz.pdf), there are figures from major media outlets that are bad!  The slides are divided into six plotting pitfalls:

• Axis trickery
• Violations of basic math
• Nearly content-free figures 
• Gratuitous chartjunk
• Poorly chosen 3D graphics 
• Bad design choices

  Please go through each of these figures (in the data viz hall of shame) and briefly describe how they are wrong or misleading.  Discuss with your classmates.

## Week 2 discussion

In the data visualization [slide deck](../slides/week2-dataviz_UT.pdf), there are figures from major media outlets that are bad!  The slides are divided into six plotting pitfalls:

1. Axis trickery
2. Violations of basic math
3. Nearly content-free figures 
4. Gratuitous chartjunk
5. Poorly chosen 3D graphics 
6. Bad design choices

Please choose one figure in each of these plotting pitfall categories and answer the following questions:

- What is the figure trying to convey?
- Why is it failing to convey this message?  What errors are made?
- What is your proposed solution for fixing this bad figure?

To summarize, your post on the discussion board should focus on six figures, and for each of these six, please answer the above questions.

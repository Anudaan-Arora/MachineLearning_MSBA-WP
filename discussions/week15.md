## Week 15 discussion

The gender pay gap is a hotly debated topic that's generated decades of research in economics and public policy.  Fundamentally, it is a causal question that must be answered with data.  Below, I've provided two references addressing this issue:

- [Gender Gaps in Performance: Evidence from Young Lawyers](readings/gendergap_lawyers.pdf)
- [Statistical Analysis of Gender Patterns in Walmart Workforce](readings/walmart.pdf) + [Appendix](readings/walmart_appendix.pdf)

The first is published in the *Journal of Political Economy*, and the second is a expert witness report from a highly publicized lawsuit against Walmart.  Your job is to read both articles and assess the evidence for a *discriminatory* gender pay gap.  Comment on methods used and strength of arguments.

## Week 4 discussion

The paper [Rich State, Poor State, Red State, Blue State: What's the Matter with Connecticut?](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/rb_qjps.pdf) discusses the peculiar trend of Republican voting share's relationship to income within and among states.  See, for example, Figures 3 and 4 in the paper.  Without worrying about the modeling details, describe qualitatively what Figure 4 is showing (the different axes, open and solid circles, etc.).  Why are the lines different slopes on the left panel?  What other variables are potentially driving the difference in these slopes?  Please be as descriptive and specific as possible, either through additional quantitative evidence outside of the paper or developing a testable hypothesis.

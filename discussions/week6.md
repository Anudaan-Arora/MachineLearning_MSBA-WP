## Week 6 discussion

This discussion will dig into the concept of dummy variables and their operation within linear models.

1. Describe the interpretation of a coefficient on a dummy variable in a linear regression model.
2. Suppose you regressed an outcome *Y* on a dummy variable *D* denoting a 1 for one subset of data and 0 for the remaining subset of data.  The least-squares coefficient on *D* is given by alpha.  What is the value of alpha in terms of the data at hand .. be very specific!
3. Describe how interactions between a dummy and continuous variable operate in a linear model.  How does one interpret these coefficients, and what modeling assumption is being made?

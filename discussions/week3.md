## Week 3 discussion

In this discussion, we will learn about Bayesian versus Frequentist probability. First, please watch the following Youtube videos.  

1. Bayes Theorem and updating explained through disease testing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R13BD8qKeTg
3. Video comparing both points of view: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsJ4W1k0hUg

First, describe in your own words the difference between Bayes and Frequentist probability.  Second, what is Bayes Theorem, and how does it relate to the computation of conditional probabilities?  Which type of person are you: a (1) Bayesian or (2) Frequetist?  Why?

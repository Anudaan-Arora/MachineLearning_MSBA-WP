## Week 11 discussion

Why is clustering an unsupervised learning task?  What are desirable features of a "good" clustering?  How do K-means and hierarchical clustering differ in their algorithms and outputs?  Lastly, even though we have left supervised learning, there is something like the bias-variance tradeoff here.  Please write a couple sentences on where this tradeoff exists in the clustering world.
